# Arduino-365-Sonar-Radar
The source code for a Sonar Radar i did during my intership. The target arduino device is a Arduino nano v3.

There are two folders containing source code:

One called Radar_360_Final which contains code for Processing3 written in Java.
This displays the Radar Graph and interfaces with the data gathered by the arduino.

The one called Arduino_Code_RADAR, contains the Arduino code. Also i included the library for the Ultrasonic Sensor. 

Here's the Circuit Diagram of how it should be connected.

Here's how the Processing3 Program looked.
